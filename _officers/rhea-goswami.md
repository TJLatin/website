Salvete, omnes! My name is Rhea, and I am one of your Artifices for the 2021 to 2022 school year. The Latin community has given me so many unique experiences, and now it is my turn to give back to it! As Artifex, I work on creating flyers for numerous LHS events, lead Myth Pumpkins, run Impromptu Art as a Latin Club event, and help design our award winning scrapbook each year alongside Alison and Tarini.
