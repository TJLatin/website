Salve! I'm Lauren and I am so excited to be one of the Praetores Maximae this year! I fell in love with Latin in 7th grade and am currently a junior in AP. My favorite part of Latin is the cult-like energy, but I also love vocabulary and derivatives (I even have the EtymOnline app on my phone!) Outside of Latin I enjoy field hockey, cooking, and listening to podcasts.
