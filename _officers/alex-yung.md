Hello! I'm Aegeus and I really look forward to convention this year, especially since it is two days now. I also look forward to diving into all the Latin activities like Lupercalia, the Ides of March, and Myth Pumpkins with my friends. Outside of Latin, I like to type frantically on my keyboard and build things like snack shelves and parallel dip bars.
