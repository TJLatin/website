Hello! I'm Alex "Aegeus" Yung, and I have been a part of Latin ever since Latin 1 with Magistra Conklin. I am one of the Praetores Magni of the Latin Honor Society for the school year of 2022-2023.

Other than Latin, I also enjoy eating various types of food, coding (mostly in Python currently), playing soccer, and playing card games (such as Pokemon and bridge).
