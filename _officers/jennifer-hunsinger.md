Hi, I’m Jennifer, and I’m one of your proconsuls this year! I love grilled cheese, Certamen, and my ugly little rat dog.

Last year, I served as both the LHS Censor (secretary) and the novice grammar censor for TJ Certamen. I’m always interested to learn about all things grammar and myth (even if I’m not that good at the latter), and I’m super excited to get to meet all of you in-person this year! Come say hi!

Also, for the record, the best two Latin club events are Rome’s Birthday and the Ides of March.
