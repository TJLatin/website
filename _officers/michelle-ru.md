Hey y'all! I'm Michelle "Cloelia" Ru and I'm one of the current consuls of TJ's Latin Honor Society! This is my 5th year of taking Latin, and it has been one of the best courses I've taken at TJ! My favorite part of being in LHS is definitely the Latin community, everyone is so supportive and kind to each other. I also love all the fun events we do, such as Rome's birthday, Myth Pumpkins, TJ Certamen, etc. and I really hope to see y'all there!
