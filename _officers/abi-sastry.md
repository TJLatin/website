I began Latin in eighth grade, but when I got to TJ I was struck by how amazing the community of Latin students were. Every activity we do, from Myth Pumpkins to NJCL exams, to organizing TJ Certamen, to state convention, brings us closer. TJ Latin has introduced me to some of my best friends and has been an academic and creative outlet for me for four years now. Looking forward to another great year!
