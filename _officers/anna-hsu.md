Salvete, omnes! I'm Anna, your LHS webmaster for the 2020-2021 school year. I've been a part of the TJ Latin family since Latin 1 with Magister Schuler, and I'll be taking AP Latin this fall. I've attended two state conventions and will be attending my second national convention in July!

Outside of Latin at TJ, I'm Co-President of [TJ Dev Club](https://activities.tjhsst.edu/devclub/), so let me know if you're ever interested in talking about web dev! The TJ Latin has been my baby since I've worked on it, and I hope that it can be a useful resource for many years to come. I've greatly enjoyed combining two of my passions during my term.

In my spare time, you can find me practicing for an upcoming piano competition, terrorizing my friends with my spaghetti JavaScript code, and eating good Taiwanese food! Feel free to contact me with any questions, and you can find out more about me on my [website](https://annaahsu.pages.dev).
