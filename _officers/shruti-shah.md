Salvete! My name is Shruti “Pompeia” Shah and I first started Latin at TJ as a freshman. My favorite part of Latin is the grammar; I love how every word is like a puzzle piece to the bigger sentence. And this year, I’m serving as your Tribune, and I can’t wait to meet all the new people and get a chance at spreading the love of Latin!
