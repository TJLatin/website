Salve! I'm Ryan and I'm a senior in Latin 5. I've been taking Latin for the last 4 years of high school. I'm heavily involved in Certamen, playing and captaining state teams at National Convention as well as serving as Rex Certaminis last year. Also, I have attended Governor's Latin Academy and coordinate Virginia Latina Loquenda events. When I'm not doing Latin things, I'm probably playing baseball (Go Nationals) or procrastinating my other schoolwork.
