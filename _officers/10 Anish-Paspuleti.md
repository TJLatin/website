Hey guys! I'm Anish, one of the domini telae, and I'm super excited to be on the lhs board. This year, I'm super excited for convention, inite, and many other TJ Latin events! Outside of Latin, when I'm not studying, you can find me talking to friends, binge-watching TV shows or enjoying junk food.
