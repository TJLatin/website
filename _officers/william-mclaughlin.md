Salvete! I'm William (aka Decimus) and I'm one of the proconsuls this year. I finished Latin 5 last year and I am currently doing an independent study class with Ms. Lister to stay in touch with the language. I previously served as LHS Auctor, and I had a great time staying involved with TJ Latin. The Latin community here is truly special, and I love going to all the different Latin club events. In particular, going to convention is always super exciting and I've made some of my favorite memories there.
