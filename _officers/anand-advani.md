Hey v'omnēs! I am Anand, your rēx certāminis and a senior in Latin V, and I'm excited for a year of hopefully back-in-person competitions and a fresh group of certātorēs to lead to victory! I also teach Ancient Greek lunch lectures on Mondays and occasionally help with grammar and history. This is my seventh year of Latin, fourth year of Certāmen, and second of Agon (Greek certamen). Please feel free to ask me about anything Latin-, Certamen-, or Greek-related, or about Linguistics Club, which I am also involved in.
