            <p>Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJ) is a Virginia Governor's School and a
                founding member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and
                Technology. TJ has been awarded the title of #1 high school in the US by US News multiple times, and
                continues to top the list in the STEM Category. This year, TJ was also awarded the title of #1 high
                school by
                Newsweek.
            <p>TJ Latin Club, together with the Latin Honor Society and our Certamen teams, is one of the most active
                academic clubs at TJ. We host fun Rome-related activities as well as rigorous tests - check out our
                pictures and awards! We are an extremely spirited community, consistently taking the top spots for
                spirit at state and national conventions. There's a multitude of opportunities for anyone interested in
                Latin to
                engage with LHS. If you like academics, you'll enjoy taking part in the myriad of tests we take during
                the
                year, many of which our students win national awards for. If you enjoy artwork, you can submit it for
                awards
                at convention and take part in various art-related Latin Honor Society activities hosted throughout the
                year. If you just want to have fun, the Roman holidays we celebrate are both educational and a blast to
                attend!
