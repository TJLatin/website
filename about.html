            <p><a href="https://tjhsst.fcps.edu/">Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJ)</a> is a
                Virginia Governor's School and a founding member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary
                Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology. TJ has been awarded the title of #1 high school in the
                US by US News multiple times, and continues to top the list in the STEM Category. 
            <p>TJ Latin Club, together with the Latin Honor Society and our Certamen teams, is one of the most active
                academic clubs at TJ. We host fun Rome-related activities as well as rigorous tests&mdash;check out our
                pictures and awards! We are an extremely spirited community, consistently taking the top spots for
                spirit at state and national conventions. There's a multitude of opportunities for anyone interested in
                Latin to engage with LHS. If you like academics, you'll enjoy taking part in the myriad of tests we take
                during the year, many of which our students win national awards for. If you enjoy artwork, you can
                submit it for awards at convention and take part in various art-related Latin Honor Society activities
                hosted throughout the year. If you just want to have fun, the Roman holidays we celebrate are both
                educational and a blast to attend!
