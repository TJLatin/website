            <p>We're so excited for NJCL Convention this year! Below, you'll find all the convention information we have
                for you at this time. Come back periodically for updates!</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that you'll need to return a signature form after you've paid for Convention and the
                deadlines for Creative and Graphic Arts are again earlier this year, register early to ensure that
                you'll be able to participate. Additionally, a week before Convention, you'll receive a link via email
                to Sched, where you'll be able to select the events you wish to attend and locate their respective Zoom
                links.</p>
            <p>Contact an officer, the Magistrae, or the listed emails on the linked documents if you have questions.
