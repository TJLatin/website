After months of hard work, a lot of code review, and a possible rewrite, we've launched our new website! You're currently visiting the static version of the site, with blogging by Jekyll. Honestly, it was a lot of fun rewriting it, since everything's super easy to use now! (Not to mention, we're developing locally!!)

Spot a bug? Visit our [Github repository](https://github.com/annaahsu/tjlatin) to open an issue, or if you're up to it, fix it yourself and create a pull request! Want to suggest a feature? Let us know! We're always open to feedback and suggestions.

If you're interested in covering a TJ Latin event for our [stories](/latin/news.html) page, submit a request on the [contact](/latin/contact.html) page to us, and we'll get back to you shortly! 

We'd like to thank the Magistrae for their continued patience as we've dealt with the long process of building a website from scratch.
