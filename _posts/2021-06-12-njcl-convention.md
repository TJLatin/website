Salvete, omnes! The time has come to prepare for NJCL Convention, which will be hosted this year virtually on Zoom. It's lots of fun, and although you may not get the sleep deprived Nats experience, we're super hyped for what this year will offer.

The Domini Telae are proud to announce that we'll be having our own version of the One Stop Shop here on the website, on the [Documents](/latin/documents/njcl.html) page, where you can find all things Nats related before you sign up and attend. If you have any questions, don't hesitate on asking an officer or a friend who has attended convention! If you've decided that it's already for you, though, NJCL has more information on signing up on their [website](https://www.njcl.org/NJCL-Convention/2021-NJCL-Convention). We hope to see you there with the VA delegation!
