It's been a pretty crazy year, and TJ Latin wasn't able to have the traditional Senior Night, but Jing, Reva, and JW put this year's Senior Send Off together, which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NdEXnmdCBJqJCckb9IrEAoUbwFkitzX7CGUw5WMvoIk/edit?usp=sharing).

We can't wait to see the great things you'll accomplish, and we hope we'll make you proud. Congratulations, 2021!
