Hey, I’m Saranya and I’m super excited to be one of your artifices this year!! I'm a junior in AP Latin, and I cant wait to put all the grammar skills I've learned over the past few years into reading real Latin. Another experience I'm looking forward to is convention. Convention was so fun last year and that was only one day, so I can't wait to have the two day experience. outside of Latin, I love working on art, spending time with friends and family, and playing with my dog Coco.
