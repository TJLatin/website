Salvete omnes! I'm Vivian, a.k.a. Delia, and I'm so excited to be serving as an artifex this year for TJ Latin! I'm really looking forward to convention, working on an amazing scrapbook to commemorate the year, and just generally helping out with both TJ Latin and sometimes certāmen. I can be found in the Latin room during lunch on most days, and occasionally lecture on Tuesdays. I also love playing certāmen, and was on the state team last year :D
