Salve! I'm Ellie Chen, and I like long walks on the beach, reciting Catullus in meter (badly), and debating intensely over translations. Outside of Latin, I enjoy studying computer science, pondering physics (phondering physics?), engaging in a creative writing hobby, and forcing friends to read my creative writing in support of said hobby. I hope to mix up my passion for writing and my love for Latin into a wonderful concoction that will become each release of the Scribe. Fac id quod amas et felix eris.
