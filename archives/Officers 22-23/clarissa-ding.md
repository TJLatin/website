Hi! I’m Clarissa, and I’m a senior taking AP Latin. Ever since I started Latin in my freshman year, I’ve been in love with the language and culture. Outside of school, I love playing and streaming video games, which I’m horrible at, reading, and hoping for service project participation as the VJCL 2VP.
