# TJ Latin
## About
Welcome to the newest iteration of the TJ Latin website! We're proud to bring an easy-to-maintain static website, with blogging by Jekyll.

## Setup
To edit this site locally, follow the [Jekyll installation directions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) for the platform of your choice and clone this repository. After successfully cloning the repository, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and visit the link your terminal provides, presumably at <http://127.0.0.1:4000/latin/>.

If you're on Windows, we suggest using [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to ensure a smooth developing experience.

## Contributing
If you're interested in contributing to our site, including both content and codebase, you can [contact us](mailto:tjlatinwebmasters@gmail.com) or simply [open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). There are no strict commit message requirements, as long as it is descriptive and concise. Contact us if you require assistance.

For developers that have access to the Director site, after merging branches into master, open up the Director terminal and execute `node index.js` to run the Netlify downloader script for deployment. Please note that it may take a minute for Netlify to deploy the Jekyll site itself, so it may take a few minutes before you can execute the command in Director successfully.
