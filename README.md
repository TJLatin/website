# TJ Latin
## About
Welcome to the newest iteration of the TJ Latin website! We're proud to bring an easy to maintain static website, with blogging by Jekyll. This was a wonderful learning experience!

## Setup
To edit this site locally, follow the [Jekyll installation directions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) for the platform of your choice and clone this repository. After successfully cloning the repository, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and visit the link your terminal provides, presumably at <http://127.0.0.1:4000/latin/>.

## Contributing
If you're interested in contributing to our site, including both content and codebase, you can [contact us](mailto:tjlatinwebmasters@gmail.com) or open a pull request.
